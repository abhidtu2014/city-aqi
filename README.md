# city-aqi

### Objective | What does the project work to achieve ?
- Pull real-time AQI Data of cities.
- To show data into tabular format.
- To show charts through Visualization library like Highcharts.js.
- To Show most recent data of Metropolitan cities.


### Business Case | What is the Problem being solved ?
- Getting real-time updates can increase user stickability and interaction.
- Tabular and Graphical Visualization makes it easy for users to compare data of different cities.

### Assumptions
- Data is being received in intervals of 2 seconds.
- Only 12 Indian cities are being pulled as AQI Data.


### Tech Stack
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as Frontend Framework
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for global State Management
- [Element-ui](https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US) for enhancing UI and pre-built components
- [Highcharts.js](https://www.highcharts.com/) for Visualizing Data into chart, specifically Highchart stock.
- [Web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) for offloading expensive work of the main thread.
- [Web socket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to Pull Real time data.
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 as origin and AWS Cloudfront as content delivery network


### Features Built (~ 10-12 hrs)
- **Metro cities AQI Overview Component**: Provides Quick look into live Data of Metropolian cities.
- **Tabular AQI Data View**: Provides Most Recent Data of all cities i.e Filterable by Category and 
  Sortable by AQI value.
- **City AQI Comparsion View**: Provides Comparsion of Historical Data Injected into graph (no limit 
  on cities selection) with pre-built timeline selector and range selector.
- **Word Cloud View**: Provides Most recent City AQI Data into word cloud where each word will carry
  weight according to its AQI value
- **Responsive Design**: Used Grids and flex to make it Highly responsive, works well with all Device
  Screen types from *SM* to *XL*.
- **Data Archival**: Data gets Automatically archived after 5 hours of active session.

## R&D and Optimizations (~ 5 hrs)
- Preloaded link tags.
- Avoided inline styles to avoid layout shifts.
- Used Hash map for O(1) Insertion.
- Avoided cloneDeep from lodash where it should have been, instead used Object.assign() for objects and 
  spread Operators for shallow copying for State Mutation.
- Used Computed Properties from Vue Component Instead of getter methods as they cache values based on their Reactive Dependencies.
- Optimised/Ì§Compressed Image assets using [imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin) and [webp images](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/using) ( 250KB-450KB to 4-8 KB)
- Using Web Worker to Reduce Blocking time to ~0ms.
- Reduce Layout Shifts to bare minimum using optimized re-rendering of components using preloading of Default view into component.

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Future Thoughts
- A good time-series Store can be used like Druid for fast querying and AWS S3 as Data lake.
- To Add Data Persistence layer on frontend(with Archival Strategy) using IndexedDB and using pre-aggregated data and setting up Indexes for Search Optimization.
- Shared Web workers can also be used, will optimize n/w load of browser having multiple tabs opened up for same application.
